```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Instruction link: http://rpubs.com/mhanauer/404665

Creating random data and creating function
```{r}
set.seed(1234)
prePHQ9 = rnorm(100, mean = 1.7, sd = 1)
postPHQ9 = rnorm(100, m = 2, sd = 1)
pChange = function(pre,post){
  round(mean((post-pre)/pre),2)
}
pChange(prePHQ9, postPHQ9)
pChange(post = postPHQ9, pre = prePHQ9)
```
Creat Formulla for standard deviation

```{r}

```


Creating histogram of a normal distribution
```{r}
normVar = rnorm(10000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
hist(normVar)
```
Creat a histogram of a non-normal ditribution
```{r}
non_normVar = rpois(10000, 3)
hist(non_normVar)
```

```{r}
z = (0--10)/3
z
```

Look up p value

```{r}
pnorm(z)
1-prnorm(z)
2*(1-pnorm(z))

```
